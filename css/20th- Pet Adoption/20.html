            <h3>Meet Jerry</h3>
            <p>
                That's sweet! You could introduce Jerry like this:  
                "This is Jerry, my energetic and adorable dog. 
                He’s the life of the house and always ready to make your day better.

            <h3>Meet Jerry</h3>
            <p>
                This is Tom, my curious and clever cat.
                He’s super playful yet loves his peaceful naps
                in cozy corners. He’s always up to some mischief,
                and life’s never boring with him around!
